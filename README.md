# Weather Forecast Website
### Weather API Control and Location by User ID
Initially it was developed for a game, however it was not possible to create any (plausible) connection with an Unreal Engine project. The project consists of a website that, in connection with a weather forecast API, obtains and returns weather information about the user's location, based on the ID of the machine used to access the website.
